  lilx - a small DOM XML parser for XML snippets

I originally wrote this for use on a microcontroller which had to talk to a
particularly micro-unfriendly device that spoke in XML. Last time I checked,
when compiling for an AVR Atmega128, the final image size of a small test
program was around 10kb.

lilx supports a very limited form of XML:

  - lilx assumes that the input starts with an opening element (i.e. does
    not support the typical opening "<?...?>" tag).

  - Element and attribute names must start with an alphanumeric 
    character.

  - All XML comments are discarded.

  - There is no support for namespaces - if an element or attribute is
    prefixed with a namespace, the namespace is considered part of the  
    element attribute/name.

  - Meta-tags (e.g. "<?xml ...", "<!CDATA ..." etc) are not supported.

  - All leading and trailing whitespace in element bodies (e.g. 
   "<a>\nfoobar\n</a>") is left intact.

Some critical parameters are set by #defines in lilx.h - adjust them for your
needs. I know, they really should be passed in as function parameters; feel
free to send me a patch if you feel the need to make this change:

  - LILX_MAX_TOKEN_LENGTH is the maximum possible size of any
    element/attribute name, and of element/attribute bodies/values.

  - LILX_STACK_SIZE is the maximum XML tree depth; most of the lilx routines
    are recursive, which can cause problems on a system with only an 8 bit
    stack. This is not a problem on a PC, so this macro should be set to a
    large value.

  - LILX_USE_SINGLE_QUOTES tells lilx whether to look for single or double
    quotes when parsing attribute values.
